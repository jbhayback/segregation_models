# Segregation Models
## Introduction
### Index of Dissimilarity (D) : Segregation Model
The Index of Dissimilarity is the most common measure of segregation. Although it has imitations, it is relatively easy to calculate and to interpret.

### Schelling's Segregation Model
Schelling's model is the mathematical version of the saying "birds of the same feather flocks together". In this simulation, an agent is happy or satisfied id its closest neighbor is the same class as to itself.

## Instructions to run the application
1. This application is executed and wrapped via [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/).
2. There are 2 methods to run it:
   - Docker container
   - Command Line Interface/Terminal

### Docker container
Prerequisites:
1. Your testing environment should have Docker installed already.
2. Docker daemon service is running.
*To know more about docker, visit [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/)*

Step by Step Process:
1. From the project directory, run **`docker image build -t st:app .`**
2. Allow all the installations to finish.
3. Once done with docker image build, execute **`docker container run -p 8501:8501 st:app`**
3. After running the app via docker container, you can access it in [localhost](http://localhost:8501).

### CLI/Terminal
Prerequisites:
1. Your testing environment should install dependencies and libraries first. Above all, Python 3 and up (preferably **3.7**) has already been installed. *All the packages that is needed to be installed is in **requirements.txt***
2. Package installation:
   - Windows : **`python3 -m pip3 install --default-timeout=100 -r requirements.txt`**
   - Linux/Ubuntu : *Given pip3 is installed prior* : **`pip3 install --default-timeout=100 -r requirements.txt`**

Step by Step Process:
1. Once installation of all the prerequisite packages is done, run the command **`streamlit run App.py`**
2. After running command, you can access the app in [localhost](http://localhost:8501).


## Application Details
**Note: Input dataset can be modified inside the Input_data.csv.**
- If you add data for another column, be sure to put header Col<column-#> prior to adding test data.
- For additional row test data, you cas just add directly.

### Dissimilarity : Segregation Model
1. The inputs can be modified in the slidebar.
2. Equal population per tract/smaller 2D-array is assumed. This means that you cannot input number of rows or column whose resulting product is not a multiple of the total population. Otherwise, an error message will appear.
   - *Example: If M=10 N=10 then the total population/cells is 100. The product of the input row(m) and column(n) should be multiple of 100 (i.e 2x2, 2x5, 5x2, 5x5, etc.)*
3. Also, the input row(m) and column(n) should be a multiple of M and N respectively. The reason behind is that the original data grid (MxN) cannot be splitted in equal population/cells of the smaller 2D-array or known as tracts in this context. An error message will appear if invalid input is set.
   - *Example: If **M=10 and N=10** then the input row(m) should be a multiple 10 (i.e 1, 2 and 5). This goes also with the input column(n).*
4. Once button for calculation **Index of Dissimilarity (D)** is clicked, the data grid or the smaller 2D array for each Tracts is displayed and the resulting **D** is shown below the button.
   
### Schelling's Model of Segregation
1. The inputs can be modified in the slidebar.
2. You can adjust the threshold of similarity depending on your choice from 0.1 to 1.0.
3. You can also adjust the number of iterations for the simulation. This is to further calculate the largest possibility of mean similarity ratio,
4. Prior to running the simulation, the first plot/graph displayed is the original data grid. **X is RED, O is BLUE and blank is WHITE**
5. After clicking run simulation button, **Both the graph and the new data grid with the largest calculated mean similarity ratio will be displayed after simulation**.

## Running Unit Tests via Pytest
1. The Unit Test is using Pytest Framework so please install Pytest before running the test:
   - Note that it is already included as required packages in the requirements.txt
   - Check the version to make sure it is properly installed (*the displayed version should be the latest pytest version*): **`pytest --version`** 
2. To start the test, run the command : **`pytest -q Tests.py`**
3. *(Optional)* You can add customized test cases to test it further. Just follow the format from the already created test scenarios.

## Troubleshooting
1. In case the installation of the prerequisite packages is failing, you can install manually the packages via CLI.
   - Example: **`pip3 install -default-timeout=100 <package-name>`** even without specifying the version.
2. If errors such a **No data/file in the directory is found** occurrs, please be sure to execute the commands within the **app directory** ot at least the CLI/Terminal is running within the project directory.
